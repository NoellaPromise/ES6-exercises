# ES6 exercises

Dear trainees, This repository contains the exercises for
[ES6, also known as ES2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/).

## Instructions

You will notice that the exercises are framed in a little story about Angela.
Angela is a very smart scientist. She has programmed some JavaScript functions to help
her automate calculations and laboratory processes for her science research. She has put one small
program in each of the files of this repository, named from
[exercise0.js](./exercise0.js) to [exercise4.js](./exercise4.js). She is a very
thorough person, so she also added test functions to see if her code works well.

Her code adheres to the
[ES5.1 / ES2011](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/) standard. **Your task in each of the exercises is to make the
code better** by using the features of
[ES6 / ES2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/) that you learned about in the past two weeks.

There are more detailed instructions on the top of each exercise file.

When you are done with all the tasks in each of the files, the code should not throw errors on execution,
and the tests that Angela wrote should still run successfully.

## Additional Instructions

- Commit and push often. It's good practice!

- You are allowed to use Google, but use of ChatGPT and other AI code is prohibited and will lead to disqualification.
